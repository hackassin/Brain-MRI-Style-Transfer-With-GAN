# Brain-MRI-Style-Transfer-With-GAN
A capstone project dedicated to leveraging Style GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to generate Brain MRI images of different contrasts

## Problem Statement
To build a Generative adversarial model(modified U-Net) which can generate artificial MRI images of different contrast levels from existing MRI scans.

## Basics of a GAN

### Components of GAN
<b>1. Discriminator :<b> A classifier network that identfies whether a generated image is fake or not.
<b>2. Generator :<b> A network that generates fake images from random noise samples. It's objective is to generate surreal images and fool the discriminator network.
