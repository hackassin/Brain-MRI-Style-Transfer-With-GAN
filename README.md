# Brain-MRI-Style-Transfer-With-GAN
A capstone project dedicated to leveraging Style GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to generate Brain MRI images of different contrasts

## Problem Statement
To build a Generative adversarial model(modified U-Net) which can generate artificial MRI images of different contrast levels from existing MRI scans.
